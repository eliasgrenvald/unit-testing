# Why TDD?

# Why TDD?
- We write the test before a single line of implementation code is written
- That test will serve as a guideline what to build and to make sure we donâ€™t break anything in the future that prevents the regular flow from working. Basically the test is some way of documenting the code.
- We implement the code to pass the test.
- And then refactor if necessary.

## Benefits
- Increases confidence to make changes to the software in future.
- Allows more agility to the developers who are not that familiar with the code and enables them to make changes without introducing errors.
- Reduces bugs. Having a failed test means no green light to go on to production.
- TDD can act as the code documentation. Tests different scenarios and somehow indicates the considerations of the original develper.
- Higher quality software.

## Pitfall
It takes longer in the short run
